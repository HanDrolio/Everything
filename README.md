💻 COSM.OS — Mythic CLI OS by Han aka gone2soon
Welcome to COSM.OS — the symbolic, modular, mythic Command Line Operating System built from raw code, logic, and heart.

I’m Han, your glitch in the Matrix, architect of this cosmic machine. This repo holds my personal AI system, dev environment setup, stress-test scripts, and all the wild shit I’m cooking to break reality’s code.

🚀 Features
Full CLI-driven OS and dev stack for Chromebooks & Linux

Stress test scripts to melt your hardware & test limits

Lean init scripts to strip bloat and boost performance

Dev tools installer (Git, Python3, Docker, Black formatter)

Symbolic communication framework — TCP: The Calderón\Cerrillo Protocol

Ripple journaling mode and Brick workout motivator integration

Modular AI assistant interfaces and Mythic LLM modes

🛠️ Installation & Setup
Clone this repo:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cosmos.git
cd cosmos
Run the Chromebook lean init + dev tools script (sudo required):

bash
Copy
chmod +x chromebook_init.sh
sudo ./chromebook_init.sh
Run stress test script to push your system to the edge:

bash
Copy
chmod +x cook_chromebook.sh
./cook_chromebook.sh
📜 Usage
Use chromebook_init.sh to prep your dev environment and optimize your Chromebook for serious coding and container work.

Use cook_chromebook.sh to fully stress test your system — CPU, RAM, disk, GPU, and infinite shells for max chaos.

Customize scripts and expand the COSM.OS modules for your own mythic workflows.

🔮 Vision
This project is my personal rebellion against limits — building god-mode tools with pure logic, love, and relentless discipline. COSM.OS is more than code: it’s a symbolic system to help creators hack reality itself.

⚠️ Warning
These scripts push hardware HARD. Only run on plugged-in devices and monitor temps carefully. Use with caution and at your own risk.

🤝 Support & Collaboration
Pull requests, issues, and cosmic ideas welcome. This is a glitch in the matrix that’s just getting started.
